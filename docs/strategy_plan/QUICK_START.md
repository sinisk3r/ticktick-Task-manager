## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Actually Use Competitor Tools
- **Why it matters**: You can't differentiate if you don't know what they do well
- **Time investment**: 6 hours (2 hours per tool)
- **Output**: Feature comparison table, gaps Context can exploit

### 2. Conduct Real Customer Interviews
- **Why it matters**: Validate "Aha Moment" before building
- **Time investment**: 5 hours (5 x 30-min calls + 2 hours synthesis)
- **Output**: Confirmation that avoidance detection resonates (or not)

### 3. Dogfood Daily (Week 2-3)
- **Why it matters**: You'll catch bugs users won't report
- **Time investment**: 30 min/day minimum
- **Output**: Smooth product by Jan 5 (beta-ready)

### 4. Fix Bugs Same-Day (Week 4)
- **Why it matters**: Shows beta users you care, builds trust
- **Time investment**: Variable (could be 30 min or 3 hours)
- **Output**: Users forgive rough edges if you're responsive

### 5. Make Go/No-Go Decision (Jan 12)
- **Why it matters**: Don't waste time on bad ideas
- **Time investment**: 2-hour retrospective
- **Output**: Clear decision to scale (≥50% retention) or pivot (<30% retention)

---

## Emergency Protocols

### If you fall behind schedule
- **Week 1 behind**: Extend by 3 days, push beta launch to Jan 15
- **Week 2-3 behind**: Cut scope (remove task breakdown, keep avoidance detection)
- **Week 4 behind**: Launch with <10 users if needed (6-8 is still valid sample)

### If co-founder drops out
- **Action**: Srikar continues solo
- **Timeline**: Extend to 6 weeks (add 2-week buffer)
- **Scope cut**: Remove onboarding flow, focus on agent core

### If zero beta signups by Dec 22
- **Action**: Personal outreach to 50 ISB alumni (mass email)
- **Backup**: Recruit from LinkedIn/Twitter (less ideal but viable)
- **Timeline**: Extend Week 1 by 1 week, push beta to Jan 19

### If retention is 0% on Jan 12
- **Action**: Emergency pivot meeting (2 hours)
- **Questions**: Is market real? Is solution right? Is ICP right?
- **Outcomes**: Persevere (rebuild V2), Pivot (change core feature), Kill (shut down)

---

## Mindset for Success

### Embrace Constraints
- **Time**: 15-20 hours/week (nights + weekends only)
- **Scope**: MVP only (no mobile app, no fancy features)
- **Users**: 10 beta users (not 100, not 1000)
- **Timeline**: 28 days (not 3 months, not 6 months)

### Ship Fast, Learn Faster
- Beta doesn't have to be perfect
- Bugs are expected (just fix them fast)
- Honest communication > Polished marketing
- Retention > Features (usage matters more than feature count)

### Celebrate Small Wins
- ✅ First beta signup → You validated interest!
- ✅ First customer interview → You're listening to users!
- ✅ First competitor test → You're learning from the best!
- ✅ First dogfood session → You're building something you'd use!
- ✅ First beta user login → You shipped!
- ✅ First "I can't go back" reaction → You found product-market fit!
