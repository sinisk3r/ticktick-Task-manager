## Interview Structure

### 1. Intro (2 min)

**Script**:
> "Hey [Name], thanks for making time! I'm building Context, an AI task manager, and want to understand how you currently manage tasks. This is pure learning - no sales pitch. I'll ask ~10 questions, should take 30 minutes. Cool if I take notes?"

**Goals**:
- Set casual, conversational tone
- Get permission to take notes (or record)
- Clarify: This is research, not a demo

---

### 2. Current Workflow (8 min)

**Q1: What tools do you currently use for task management?**
- Probe: TickTick, Todoist, Notion, pen & paper, memory?
- Follow-up: How long have you used [tool]? What made you choose it?

**Q2: Walk me through your typical morning. How do you decide what to work on?**
- Listen for: Do they have a system? Or is it chaos?
- Probe: Do you plan the night before? Or wing it?

**Q3: What's the most frustrating part of your current task management system?**
- This is THE question. Let them vent.
- Follow-up: How often does this frustration happen? Daily? Weekly?

**Q4: Tell me about a task you've been avoiding. Why haven't you started it?**
- Listen for: "It's too vague" or "It's overwhelming" or "I don't know where to start"
- This validates the avoidance detection hypothesis

---

### 3. Pain Point Deep Dive (8 min)

**Q5: How do you currently prioritize tasks? (Urgent vs Important)**
- Listen for: Do they use Eisenhower? Or just "what's on fire?"
- Probe: Do you ever feel like you're always in reactive mode?

**Q6: Have you tried productivity tools like Motion, Reclaim, or Sunsama?**
- If yes: What did you like? What made you stop using it?
- If no: What stopped you from trying them? (Price? Complexity? Didn't know they exist?)

**Q7: When you look at your task list, how do you feel? (Overwhelmed, in control, indifferent?)**
- This gauges emotional relationship with tasks
- Follow-up: What would make you feel MORE in control?

---

### 4. "Aha Moment" Validation (7 min)

**Setup**:
> "I want to test a concept with you. Imagine your task manager could detect when you're avoiding a task - like, it notices you created 'Plan Q1 strategy' 3 weeks ago but haven't touched it. It asks: 'This feels too vague. Want me to break it into 3 concrete steps?' What do you think?"

**Q8: Would that be helpful or annoying?**
- Listen for: Excitement ("OMG yes!") or skepticism ("Meh, maybe")
- Follow-up: Why? What makes it helpful/annoying?

**Q9: What if the breakdown was tailored to YOUR work style? Like, if you prefer detailed checklists, it gives you that. If you prefer high-level themes, it keeps it loose. Does that make a difference?**
- This validates the personality adaptation hypothesis
- Listen for: "Wait, how would it know my work style?" (great question - UX opportunity)

**Q10: If this actually worked - like, it helped you start tasks you've been avoiding - how much would that be worth to you per month?**
- Listen for: Numeric answer ($5, $10, $20) or "I wouldn't pay" (honest feedback)
- Follow-up: Would you expect a free tier? What should be free vs paid?

---

### 5. Closing & Referrals (5 min)

**Wrap-up**:
> "This was super helpful. Last question: If I built this, would you actually use it? Even if it's rough around the edges?"

- Listen for: Genuine interest vs polite "maybe"
- If interested: "Great! I'll add you to the beta list. Launching in early Jan."

**Referral ask**:
> "Do you know anyone else who's drowning in tasks? I'm looking for 5-10 people to test this with."

- Goal: Get 1-2 intros from each interview
- Track referrals in interview notes

**Thank you**:
> "Thanks for the honesty, [Name]. I'll keep you posted on progress. And if I build this, you'll get lifetime free access for helping!"

## Tips for Great Interviews

### Do's ✅
- **Listen more than you talk** (80/20 rule)
- **Ask "why" 3 times** (get to root cause)
- **Let silence happen** (people reveal more when you don't fill gaps)
- **Take exact quotes** (not paraphrases)
- **Be curious, not defensive** (if they hate your idea, dig deeper!)

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't pitch your product** (this is research, not sales)
- **Don't ask leading questions** ("Wouldn't it be great if...?")
- **Don't explain your vision** (you're here to learn THEIR pain)
- **Don't argue with feedback** ("Actually, our product does that...")
- **Don't skip the "willingness to pay" question** (it's uncomfortable but critical)

## Interview Success Metrics

After 5 interviews, you should be able to answer:

1. **What's the #1 pain point?** (If 3+ people say the same thing, it's real)
2. **Does the "Aha Moment" resonate?** (Excitement = good, "meh" = pivot)
3. **Will people pay?** (If 3+ say $10/mo, you have a business)
4. **What features can we cut?** (If no one mentions it, it's not MVP-critical)
5. **Who's the best ICP?** (PMs? Founders? Engineers? Students?)

*Good luck! Remember: The goal is to learn, not to validate your assumptions.*
