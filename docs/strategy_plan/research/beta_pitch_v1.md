# Beta User Pitch Messages - V1

**Created**: December 16, 2025
**Target Audience**: ISB alumni (warm contacts)
**Goal**: 10 beta signups from 20 outreach messages (50% conversion)

---

## Version A: Short Email (3 Sentences)

**Use case**: First outreach to warm contacts, ISB alumni you know but haven't spoken to recently

**Subject**: Quick favor - testing my AI task manager

**Body**:
```
Hey [Name],

I'm building an AI task manager that adapts to your work style (like having an assistant that knows you prefer structured tasks vs. big-picture guidance). I'm looking for 10 ISB alumni to beta test it in January - you'd get free forever access and direct input on features. Would you be interested? I'll send access in early Jan.

- Srikar

P.S. Here's a quick signup form if you're in: [INSERT FORM LINK]
```

**Why this works**:
- Respects their time (3 sentences, no fluff)
- ISB alumni connection establishes trust
- Clear value prop: "adapts to your work style" (differentiator)
- Low commitment ask ("would you be interested" vs. "will you commit")
- P.S. with form link makes it easy to say yes

---

## Version B: LinkedIn DM (Casual, 2 Paragraphs)

**Use case**: ISB alumni you're connected with on LinkedIn, semi-familiar

**Message**:
```
Hey [Name]! Hope you're doing well.

I'm building something I wish I had as a PM - an AI task manager that actually knows how you work. Think: your tasks pile up, you avoid the vague ones, Context (my app) notices the pattern and suggests breaking them down into concrete steps - the way you prefer. It sits on top of TickTick and learns your cognitive style over time.

I'm looking for 10 ISB folks to beta test it in January. You'd get free forever access (even when I launch paid tiers) + direct say in what features get built. Interested? No pressure if you're swamped - but if task management is a pain point for you, I'd love your feedback.

Signup form: [INSERT FORM LINK]
```

**Why this works**:
- Casual tone ("Hope you're doing well" - LinkedIn norm)
- Concrete example (avoidance detection) instead of vague promises
- Founder vulnerability ("something I wish I had") - relatable
- "No pressure" gives them easy out (paradoxically increases response)
- Clear incentive: free forever + input on roadmap

---

## Version C: WhatsApp Message (Very Casual, Bullet Points)

**Use case**: Close ISB friends, classmates you still talk to regularly

**Message**:
```
Hey [Name]!

Building a side project and need your help testing it. It's an AI task manager that adapts to how you work (not just what you need to do).

Quick example:
- You create task "Research competitor X" in TickTick
- Context notices you haven't touched it in 3 weeks
- Flags it: "Too vague? Let me break this into 3 concrete steps for you"
- You actually start it (because it's not overwhelming anymore)

Looking for 10 beta users from ISB to test in Jan. You'd get:
- Free forever (even when paid tier launches)
- Direct input on features
- Your own "AI work twin" that learns your style

Interested? Takes 2 min to sign up: [INSERT FORM LINK]

(If not your thing, no worries - just thought of you since we've both complained about task management apps before!)
```

**Why this works**:
- WhatsApp-native format (bullets, casual language)
- Concrete use case (not abstract "productivity" talk)
- "AI work twin" is sticky phrase (memorable positioning)
- Acknowledges shared pain point ("we've both complained")
- Parenthetical gives easy no (increases yes rate)

---

## Supporting Materials Needed

**Google Form / Typeform Questions**:
1. Name
2. Email
3. ISB batch/year (for context)
4. Current task management system (Motion, Reclaim, TickTick, Notion, etc.)
5. Biggest task management pain point (open text)
6. Would you pay $5-15/mo for a task manager that adapts to your work style? (Yes/No/Maybe)

**Follow-up after signup**:
- Immediate: "Thanks for signing up! I'll send beta access in early January. In the meantime, here's what to expect: [link to onboarding doc]"
- 1 week before launch: "Beta access coming Dec 30th - make sure TickTick is set up"
- Launch day: "Your Context beta is ready: [link] - here's a 3-min demo video"

---

## Outreach Strategy

**Batch 1 (20 warm contacts)**:
- 10 close ISB friends (WhatsApp Version C)
- 7 LinkedIn connections (LinkedIn Version B)
- 3 formal emails (Email Version A)

**Expected conversion**:
- Close friends: 70-80% (7-8 signups)
- LinkedIn: 30-40% (2-3 signups)
- Formal emails: 20-30% (0-1 signups)
- **Total**: 10-12 signups (goal: 10 committed beta users)

**Follow-up cadence**:
- Day 3: Gentle nudge if no response ("Hey, did you see my message about Context? No pressure if you're swamped!")
- Day 7: Last follow-up ("Closing beta signups this weekend - let me know if you're interested!")
- Day 10: Move on (don't spam)

**Interview incentive**:
- Offer $25 Amazon gift card for 30-min feedback call
- Position as "user research" not "sales call"
- 5 interviews target (from 10 signups)

## What NOT to Say (Pitfalls to Avoid)

1. **Don't oversell**: "This will revolutionize productivity" - sounds like every other app
2. **Don't be vague**: "AI-powered task management" - what does that even mean?
3. **Don't ask for too much**: "Would you beta test for 6 months?" - too big a commitment
4. **Don't ignore their time**: Long paragraphs explaining technical architecture - they don't care yet
5. **Don't fake scarcity**: "Only 10 spots left!" - they know you're recruiting

**Instead**: Be honest, specific, humble. "I'm building this for me, thought you might have the same problem."

---

## Success Criteria

**Good outcome**:
- 10/20 respond (50% response rate)
- 10/20 sign up (50% conversion)
- 5/10 agree to interview (50% interview rate)

**Great outcome**:
- 15/20 respond (75% response rate)
- 12/20 sign up (60% conversion)
- 7/12 agree to interview (58% interview rate)

**Red flag**:
- <5/20 respond (25% response rate) - messaging not resonating OR wrong audience
- <5/20 sign up (25% conversion) - problem not compelling enough

**If conversion is low**: Don't panic. It's warm contacts, so high response rate matters more. If people respond but don't sign up, it's a signal to refine the value prop.

## Post-Signup Flow

**Email Template (After Form Submission)**:
```
Subject: Context beta access - what to expect

Hey [Name],

Thanks for signing up to beta test Context! Here's what happens next:

**Timeline**:
- Dec 30: I'll send your beta access link
- Jan 1-7: Onboarding week (connect TickTick, try the chat)
- Jan 15: Quick feedback call (30 min, optional - I'll pay $25 Amazon gift card)

**What you'll get**:
- Free forever access (even when I launch paid tiers in Feb/March)
- Direct input on features (your feedback shapes the roadmap)
- Your own "AI work twin" that learns your work style

**What I need from you**:
- Use it for at least 2 weeks (so the AI learns your patterns)
- Be brutally honest in feedback (tell me what sucks)
- Optionally: 30-min call mid-January to discuss what's working/not working

Sound good? Reply if you have questions - otherwise, see you on Dec 30!

- Srikar

P.S. Make sure you have a TickTick account set up (free tier is fine). Context sits on top of it, so you'll need to connect during onboarding.
```

## Objection Handling

**"I'm too busy to test beta software"**
> Totally get it. How about this: Use it for just 15 min this week. If it doesn't feel useful, bail immediately. No hard feelings.

**"I'm happy with [current tool]"**
> Love to hear what makes [tool] great for you! Mind if I ask what you'd change about it if you could?
>
> (I'm genuinely learning, not trying to convince you to switch.)

**"What's in it for me?"**
> Fair question! You get:
> 1. Free lifetime access (even if we charge later)
> 2. Say in roadmap (your feature requests get prioritized)
> 3. Direct line to me (I'll fix your bugs same-day)
>
> It's early access + VIP treatment. Worth 30 min of testing?

**"Is this free?"**
> Beta is 100% free. After launch, there'll be a free tier (basic features) and paid tier ($5-15/mo for personality adaptation).
>
> But beta testers get lifetime free access to paid tier. So you're locked in at $0 forever.

**"I don't use TickTick"**
> No worries! You can create a free TickTick account just for Context. Or wait - we're adding support for Todoist/Google Tasks post-beta.
>
> Would TickTick be a dealbreaker? (Helps me prioritize integrations.)
