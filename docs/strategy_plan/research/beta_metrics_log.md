## Power User Analysis

**Definition**: Used Context 5+ days in Week 1

| User | Days Active | Tasks Created | Agent Queries | What They Love | What They Want |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| [Name] | 0/7       | 0             | 0             | [Quote]        | [Feature request] |
| [Name] | 0/7       | 0             | 0             | [Quote]        | [Feature request] |

**Key Insights**:
- [What makes power users love Context?]
- [What features do they use most?]
- [What would make them pay?]

---

## Churned User Analysis

**Definition**: Logged in once, never came back

| User | Login Date | Last Active | Why They Churned | Follow-up |
|------|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| [Name] | Jan 6    | Jan 6       | [Reason from interview] | [Action taken] |
| [Name] | Jan 6    | Jan 6       | [Reason from interview] | [Action taken] |

**Churn Reasons**:
1. **[Reason 1]**: [# users, % of total churned]
2. **[Reason 2]**: [# users, % of total churned]
3. **[Reason 3]**: [# users, % of total churned]

**Key Insights**:
- [Why are users leaving?]
- [Is it fixable? Or fundamental problem?]
- [Should we pivot?]

---

## Decision: Expand or Pivot?

### If Retention ≥ 50% (SUCCESS PATH)

**Evidence**:
- 5+ users came back on Day 7
- 3+ users said "I can't go back"
- NPS ≥ 40
- Power users use it daily

**Next Steps**:
- Expand to 50 ISB alumni (Week 5)
- Add top 2 requested features
- Test soft paywall ($5/mo indie tier)
- Prepare for Product Hunt launch

---

### If Retention < 30% (FAILURE PATH)

**Evidence**:
- <3 users came back on Day 7
- Most users churned after Day 1
- NPS < 20
- No clear "Aha Moment" happened

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Hypothesis 1**: [e.g., "Avoidance detection didn't resonate"]
   - Evidence: [User quotes, feature usage data]
   - Fix: [e.g., "Test auto-scheduling instead"]
2. **Hypothesis 2**: [e.g., "UX too confusing"]
   - Evidence: [User quotes, where they got stuck]
   - Fix: [e.g., "Rebuild onboarding flow"]
3. **Hypothesis 3**: [e.g., "TickTick dependency too fragile"]
   - Evidence: [Sync issues, error logs]
   - Fix: [e.g., "Go local-first, TickTick optional"]

**Decision**:
- [ ] **Persevere**: Rebuild core feature, test with new cohort (4 weeks)
- [ ] **Pivot**: Change target user or value prop (restart discovery)
- [ ] **Kill**: Shut down, share learnings, move to next idea

**Timeline**: [What's next 30 days look like?]

---

### If Retention 30-50% (MIXED PATH)

**Evidence**:
- 3-5 users came back on Day 7
- Some love it, some don't
- NPS between 20-40

**Key Questions**:
1. Who are the power users? (What's their profile?)
2. Who are the churned users? (What's their profile?)
3. Can we narrow ICP to just power users?
4. What ONE feature would convert "meh" to "love"?

**Next Steps**:
- Interview power users + churned users
- Identify pattern (role, work style, use case)
- Rebuild for narrower ICP
- Test with 10 new users matching power user profile

---

## Final Reflection (Jan 12, 2026)

**What Worked**:
1. [Success 1]
2. [Success 2]
3. [Success 3]

**What Didn't Work**:
1. [Failure 1]
2. [Failure 2]
3. [Failure 3]

**Biggest Surprise**:
- [What did we NOT expect?]

**Key Learning**:
- [What's the ONE thing we learned that changes everything?]

**Next 30 Days**:
- [What are we building/testing next?]
