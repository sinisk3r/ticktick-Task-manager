# YouTube/Twitter Influencer Targets

**Purpose**: Track productivity influencers to approach for sponsored content/reviews
**Timeline**: Phase 3 (May-Jun 2026) - after Product Hunt launch
**Budget**: $2,500 (5 influencers x $500 each)

---

## Target Criteria

**Ideal influencer profile**:
- 10K-100K subscribers/followers (micro-influencers, not mega stars)
- Productivity/task management niche
- Audience: PMs, founders, knowledge workers (our ICP)
- Authentic voice (not overly promotional)
- Previous reviews of Motion/Reclaim/Sunsama (knows the space)

**Why micro-influencers**:
- Higher engagement rates than mega influencers (5-10% vs. 1-2%)
- More affordable ($500 vs. $5,000)
- Audience trusts them more (not celebrity endorsements)
- Better ROI (500 signups from $500 = $1 CPA)

## Outreach Template (Phase 3)

**Subject**: Sponsorship opportunity - AI task manager (Context)

**Body**:
```
Hey [Name],

I've been following your content on [YouTube/Twitter] and love your reviews of [Motion/Reclaim/Sunsama]. Your [specific video/thread] really resonated with me.

I'm building Context - an AI task manager that adapts to your cognitive style (think: personality-aware task management). We just hit [100/1,000 users] with [60%/50%] retention.

Would you be interested in reviewing it? I'd offer:
- $500 for a 5-min sponsored segment in your next video
- Free Pro tier access (worth $15/mo)
- Affiliate link (20% commission on signups)

No pressure if it's not a fit - but thought you'd find the personality adaptation angle interesting (it's what Motion/Reclaim don't do).

Here's a 3-min demo if you're curious: [YouTube link]

Looking forward to hearing from you!

- Srikar
Founder, Context
[LinkedIn/Twitter/Website]
```

**Why this works**:
- Personalized (references their specific content)
- Shows traction (100/1,000 users, 60% retention)
- Clear value exchange ($500 + free product + affiliate)
- Differentiates from competitors (personality adaptation)
- Easy out ("No pressure if it's not a fit")

## Tracking Metrics

### Phase 3 (May-Jun 2026)

**Outreach**:
- Contacted: 0/10 (0%)
- Responded: 0/10 (0%)
- Agreed to sponsor: 0/5 (target)

**Performance** (per influencer):
- Views: [TBD]
- Click-through rate: [TBD] (target: 5-10%)
- Signups: [TBD] (target: 100-200 per video)
- CPA: [TBD] (target: $2.50-5.00 per signup)

**ROI Calculation**:
- $500 per video x 5 videos = $2,500
- Target: 500-1,000 signups = $2.50-5.00 CPA
- LTV: $60-180 per user (12-month value) = 12-36x ROI

---

## Affiliate Program (Alternative to Sponsorship)

**Offer**:
- 20% commission on first 12 months of paid subscriptions
- Free Pro tier for influencer
- Custom affiliate link with tracking

**Why influencers say yes**:
- No upfront payment needed (performance-based)
- Ongoing revenue (not one-time $500)
- Aligns incentives (they want their audience to use it)

**Example**:
- Influencer refers 100 users
- 10 convert to Indie tier ($5/mo) + 5 convert to Pro tier ($15/mo)
- Monthly commission: (10 x $5 x 0.2) + (5 x $15 x 0.2) = $10 + $15 = $25/mo
- 12-month commission: $300 (vs. $500 one-time sponsorship)

**Trade-off**: Lower upfront cost, but slower payout. Good for Phase 2 (budget-constrained).

## Red Flags (Influencers to Avoid)

**Don't approach if**:
- Engagement rate <2% (bought followers)
- Only does sponsored content (no organic reviews)
- Audience mismatch (students, not knowledge workers)
- Negative reviews of similar tools (won't be authentic)
- Too expensive (>$1,000 for <100K subs)
