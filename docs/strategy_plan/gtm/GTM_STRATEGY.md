# Go-to-Market Strategy

**Last Updated**: December 16, 2025
**Status**: Pre-launch (Alpha, targeting beta in Q1 2026)
**Owner**: Srikar + Co-founder
**Goal**: 1,000 users by end of 2026 ($10K MRR)

---

## Core Positioning

### Tagline
> "The personal assistant that works for you and with you, the way you do."

### Problem Statement
Tasks rot in your backlog. You avoid the vague ones, get overwhelmed by structure, and productivity tools force everyone into the same workflow - but high-performers have fundamentally different cognitive styles.

### Solution Statement
Context is your AI work twin that adapts to HOW you think, not just what you need to do. It spots avoidance patterns, breaks down tasks YOUR way (structured vs. big-picture), and protects time for deep work.

### Key Differentiator
**Not one-size-fits-all.** Unlike Motion (rigid auto-scheduling) or Reclaim (calendar-only), Context learns your cognitive style and adapts to it.

---

## Target Audience (ICP)

### Initial Launch (Beta - Q1 2026)
**Who**: ISB (Indian School of Business) alumni
**Size**: 9,000 contacts
**Why**: Business-savvy, productivity-focused, high task volume, built-in trust (Srikar is ISB alum)

**Ideal beta user profile**:
- Product managers, consultants, startup founders
- Managing 50+ tasks/week across multiple projects
- Tried Motion/Reclaim/Sunsama but found them too rigid
- Pain: Tasks pile up, avoid ambiguous ones, no system that "gets them"

### Expansion (Post-Beta - Q2-Q4 2026)
**Who**: Knowledge workers in high-volume roles
**Where**: Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube

**ICP characteristics**:
- **Role**: PMs, founders, consultants, executives
- **Pain**: Task overload, avoidance patterns, tool fatigue
- **Behavior**: Active on productivity Twitter/Reddit, early adopter mindset
- **Willingness to pay**: $5-15/mo for tools that save time

---

## Messaging Strategy

### Core Message Framework

**For different personas**:

**"TJ" Types (Structured, Detail-Oriented)**:
- "Context breaks your ambiguous tasks into concrete, structured milestones - the way you prefer."
- Example: "Here's your Q1 priorities broken into 3 concrete steps with dependencies"

**"FP" Types (Flexible, Big-Picture)**:
- "Context keeps your tasks high-level and theme-based - no overwhelming rigidity."
- Example: "This week's theme is stakeholder alignment - here are the 2 big conversations to have"

**For All Users**:
- "Your AI work twin that knows you."
- "Stop fighting your brain. Let Context adapt to it."
- "The more you use it, the more it becomes YOUR system."

### Pain Point Messaging

**Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) Framework**:

**Problem**: You create tasks with good intentions. Life gets busy. They disappear into the void.

**Agitate**: Motion auto-schedules but doesn't understand your work style. Reclaim protects time but doesn't help with prioritization. Sunsama's daily ritual feels like homework. None of them adapt to HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS.

**Solution**: Context learns your patterns, spots avoidance, breaks down tasks YOUR way, and protects wellbeing - not just efficiency.

### Objection Handling

**Objection 1**: "I already use Motion/Reclaim/TickTick"
**Response**: Context sits on top of TickTick (or any task manager). It's not a replacement - it's an AI layer that adapts to your work style. Try it for a week without switching tools.

**Objection 2**: "Another AI productivity tool? I've tried them all"
**Response**: Most AI tools optimize for MORE (more tasks, more meetings). Context optimizes for SUSTAINABLE productivity. It spots when you're avoiding tasks or burning out - and adapts.

**Objection 3**: "Why should I trust AI with my tasks?"
**Response**: Context uses open architecture (OpenRouter, Claude, GPT, or local Ollama). You control where your data goes. Privacy-first.

**Objection 4**: "$15/mo is expensive for a task manager"
**Response**: If you make $100K/year ($50/hr), saving 1 hour/week = $200/mo value. $15 is 7.5% of that. Plus, free tier available.

---

## Launch Channels (Phased Rollout)

### Phase 1: Private Beta (Jan-Feb 2026) - 10 Users
**Goal**: Validate product-market fit with warm contacts

**Channel**: Direct outreach to ISB alumni (warm contacts)
**Tactic**: Personal WhatsApp/LinkedIn/email messages (see `research/beta_pitch_v1.md`)

**Success criteria**:
- 60% Week 2 retention (6/10 users)
- 50% Month 1 retention (5/10 users)

**Why private beta first**: Learn fast, iterate privately, avoid "launched too early" stigma

---

**Goal**: Scale to 100 users if retention holds from Phase 1

**Channel 1: ISB Alumni Mass Email**

2. **Interview incentive** - $25 Amazon gift card for 30-min feedback call
3. **Free forever promise** - First 100 users get lifetime free access

## Unit Economics (Freemium Model)

### Pricing Tiers

**Free Tier**:
- Basic conversational agent
- TickTick sync
- Eisenhower Matrix
- OpenRouter free models (DeepSeek, Llama)
- **LLM cost**: $0/user/month
- **Price**: $0
- **Margin**: N/A (lead generation)

**Indie Tier ($5/mo)**:
- Better models (DeepSeek paid, Claude Haiku)
- Weekly avoidance reports
- Work style analysis
- Priority support
- **LLM cost**: $0.10-0.50/user/month
- **Price**: $5
- **Margin**: 90-97%

- Full Myers-Briggs detection
- Energy cycle analysis
- API access
- **LLM cost**: $2-5/user/month
- **Price**: $15
- **Margin**: 67-75%

### Break-Even Analysis

**Costs**:
- LLM: $0-50/mo (free tier initially, $500-2K/mo at scale)
- Hosting: $20-50/mo (Railway + Vercel, scales to $200-500/mo at 1K users)
- Tools: $20/mo (GitHub, Figma, analytics)
- **Total monthly burn**: <$100/mo (beta), $700-2,500/mo (1K users)

**Break-even targets**:
- **Phase 1 (10 users)**: No revenue, <$100/mo burn (sustainable)
- **Phase 2 (100 users)**: $500-1,500 MRR (need 100-300 paid users to break even at $200/mo burn)
- **Phase 3 (1K users)**: $5K-10K MRR (need 333-666 paid users to break even at $1,500/mo burn)
- **Phase 4 (10K users)**: $30K-50K MRR (profitable, can invest in growth)

### Conversion Assumptions

**Free → Indie (5% conversion)**:
- 1,000 free users → 50 Indie users → $250/mo MRR

**Free → Pro (2% conversion)**:
- 1,000 free users → 20 Pro users → $300/mo MRR

**Total MRR from 1,000 users**: $550/mo (conservative)

**Optimistic scenario** (10% Indie, 5% Pro):
- 1,000 users → 100 Indie + 50 Pro → $500 + $750 = $1,250/mo MRR

**Goal**: Hit $10K MRR by end of 2026 (need 5,000-10,000 users assuming 5-10% conversion)

---

**Offer**: Even when paid tiers launch, first 100 beta users get Pro tier free forever

**Why**: Creates loyalty, evangelism, and urgency ("Only 23 spots left!")

---

## What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

### 1. Don't Spam ISB Alumni Email List
**Why**: Damages reputation, low conversion, feels impersonal

**Instead**: Personal outreach to warm contacts first (20 messages → 10 signups). If that works, expand gradually to broader network (batches of 50, not mass blast).

---

### 2. Don't Launch on Product Hunt Too Early
**Why**: "Launched too early" stigma is hard to recover from. If retention is <50%, users will churn and leave bad reviews.

**Instead**: Wait until Month 1 retention is solid (50%+), then launch with testimonials and proven metrics.

---

### 3. Don't Promise Features Not in V1
**Why**: Erodes trust when you can't deliver. Users expect features you mentioned.

**Instead**: Be honest about roadmap: "Email drafting is coming in V2, but not in beta." Under-promise, over-deliver.

---

### 4. Don't Ignore Churned Users
**Why**: They have the most valuable feedback (why didn't it work?).

**Instead**: Follow up with every churned user: "Hey, I noticed you stopped using Context - can I ask why? 15-min call, I'll pay $25 Amazon gift card."

---

### 5. Don't Copy Competitors (Motion, Reclaim)
**Why**: You'll lose on features and polish. Differentiation is your moat.

**Instead**: Focus on what they DON'T do (personality adaptation). Let Motion own calendar blocking, Reclaim own time protection - you own cognitive style adaptation.

---

### 6. Don't Build Too Many Features
**Why**: Feature creep kills focus. V1 should do ONE thing well (conversational task management + avoidance detection).

**Instead**: Ruthlessly cut features. If it's not in V1 MVP list, it's V2.

---

### 7. Don't Neglect Metrics
**Why**: You'll optimize for vanity (signups) instead of value (retention).

**Instead**: Track retention, engagement, NPS weekly. Make data-driven decisions.

---

### 8. Don't Overspend on Ads Too Early
**Why**: CAC/LTV unproven, you'll burn money.

**Instead**: Grow organically (ISB, LinkedIn, Reddit) until you have 1,000 users and proven conversion rates. Then test paid ads with small budgets ($500/month).
