## Content Templates

### Building in Public (LinkedIn/Twitter)

**Template**:
```
[Metric Update] + [Insight] + [Lesson Learned]

Example:
"Week 5 of Context: Hit 100 users, 60% retention.

Biggest insight: Users with 10+ chat messages in Week 1 have 80% Week 2 retention. Chat engagement predicts stickiness.

Lesson: We're doubling down on onboarding tutorial to drive chat habit early.

What we're shipping next: [Feature X]"
```

**Why this works**:
- Transparent (real metrics, not vanity)
- Actionable (insight → lesson → action)
- Forward-looking (what's next)

---

### User Story (LinkedIn/Twitter/Blog)

**Template**:
```
[Problem] → [Context Solution] → [Outcome]

Example:
"Sarah (PM at tech company) had 'Research competitor X' on her todo list for 3 weeks.

Context flagged it: 'Too vague? Let me break this into 3 concrete steps.'

She completed it in 2 days. Her reaction: 'I've never had a tool call me out like this.'"
```

**Why this works**:
- Relatable problem (task avoidance)
- Concrete solution (breakdown)
- Emotional outcome (quote)

---

### Educational Content (Blog/YouTube)

**Template**:
```
[Problem Statement] → [Why It Happens] → [5 Strategies] → [Call-to-Action]

Example:
"Why You Avoid Tasks (And How to Stop)

We all have tasks that rot in our backlog. Why?

[Psychology of avoidance: vague tasks, perfectionism, decision fatigue]

5 Strategies That Work:
1. Break it into 3 concrete steps
2. Set a 5-min timer (start small)
3. Externalize accountability (tell someone)
4. Reframe the task (focus on why it matters)
5. Use an AI assistant (shameless plug: Context does this for you)

Try one this week. Let me know what works."
```

**Why this works**:
- Addresses pain point (avoidance)
- Provides value (5 strategies)
- Soft CTA (try Context)
