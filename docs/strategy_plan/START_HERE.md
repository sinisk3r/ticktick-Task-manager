---

## 📖 Document Index (Read in This Order)

### **1. Vision & Master Plan** (Read First - 30 min)
**File**: `VISION_AND_PLAN.md`

This is your **north star document**. Read this fully before doing anything else.

**What it covers**:
- The vision (AI work twin that adapts to your cognitive style)
- Your extreme user profile (Srikar = Product Manager juggling 3 projects)
- 4 defensible moats (personality adaptation, TickTick depth, wellbeing, open architecture)
- MVP scope (IN: conversational agent, avoidance detection | OUT: email drafting, calendar blocking)
- Business model (Freemium $0/$5/$15, 67-97% margins)
- 30-day launch plan overview
- Success metrics (60% week-2 retention)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Quit criteria (honesty check)

**Why read first**: This aligns you and your co-founder on what you're building and why.

---

### **2. 30-Day Task List** (Your Daily Playbook - 60 min)
**File**: `30_DAY_TASK_LIST.md`

This is your **tactical execution plan**. 1,051 lines of detailed, week-by-week tasks with deadlines.

**Structure**:
- **Week 1 (Dec 16-22)**: Customer Discovery - Test Motion/Reclaim, interview 5 users, recruit 10 beta signups
- **Week 2-3 (Dec 23 - Jan 5)**: MVP Build - Conversational agent + avoidance detection + task breakdown
- **Week 4 (Jan 6-12)**: Beta Launch - Ship to 10 users, measure 60% week-2 retention, decide scale/iterate/pivot

**Features**:
- Clear ownership (Srikar vs Co-founder)
- Realistic for nights/weekends (15-20 hrs/week)
- Measurable success criteria for each week
- Emergency protocols for common failures

**Start here TODAY**: Read Week 1, do the first 3 tasks (sign up for Motion/Reclaim, draft pitch, send to 20 contacts).

---

### **3. Quick Start Guide** (2-Hour Action Plan)
**File**: `QUICK_START.md`

Don't have time to read 50 pages? Start here.

**What it covers**:
- 2-hour action plan to get started TODAY
- Week-by-week preview with checklists
- Daily rituals (10 min/day)
- Critical success factors (ruthless prioritization, dogfooding, retention-first)

**Use this**: When you're overwhelmed and need to focus on the next 2 hours only.

---

### **4. Cheat Sheet** (1-Page Reference Card)
**File**: `CHEAT_SHEET.md`

Your **daily reference** (print or bookmark).

**What it covers**:
- Timeline at a glance (Week 1-4 milestones)
- Key metrics (60% retention, <3 critical bugs, 5+ dogfood days)
- Decision trees (If retention ≥50% → Scale | If <30% → Pivot)
- Emergency contacts (What to do if TickTick API breaks, co-founder drops out, etc.)

**Use this**: Daily check-in to stay on track.

---

## 🔬 Research & Market Intelligence

### **5. Competitor Analysis** (Read Before Testing Competitors)
**File**: `research/competitor_analysis.md`

**What it covers**:
- Motion ($19-49/mo): Auto-scheduling powerhouse, expensive, no wellbeing features
- Reclaim ($0-22/mo): Calendar optimization, no mobile app (biggest complaint), limited free tier
- TickTick ($0-3/mo): Cheap, great mobile, NO AI features
- Context's competitive advantages (7 unique differentiators)

**Key insights**:
- **Wellbeing-first positioning** - Motion/Reclaim maximize productivity, Context protects health
- **$5-15/mo sweet spot** - More affordable than Motion, more features than Reclaim
- **TickTick enhancement model** - "TickTick + AI brain" instead of competing directly
- **Task meaning analysis** - LLM explains WHY tasks matter, not just WHEN to do them

**Action**: Read this BEFORE you test Motion/Reclaim yourself (so you know what to look for).

---

### **6. Beta Pitch Messages** (Recruit Your First 10 Users)
**File**: `research/beta_pitch_v1.md`

**What it covers**:
- 3 pitch message versions (Email/LinkedIn/WhatsApp) tailored by relationship strength
- Tone: Humble, founder-to-founder, asking for help (not selling)
- Google Form signup questions
- Outreach strategy (20 contacts: 10 WhatsApp, 7 LinkedIn, 3 email)
- Expected conversion: 50% (10 signups from 20 contacts)

**Key positioning**: "AI work twin" that adapts to your cognitive style

**Action**: Use Version C (WhatsApp) for close ISB friends, Version B (LinkedIn) for semi-familiar contacts, Version A (Email) for warm alumni you haven't spoken to recently.

---

### **7. Research Hub Navigator** (How to Use All Research Files)
**File**: `research/README.md`

**What it covers**:
- Purpose of each research file (when to update, how to use, common pitfalls)
- 6 core file types (competitor analysis, customer interviews, beta testing, metrics)
- 4 practical scenarios (feature decisions, retention troubleshooting, Product Hunt launch, investor pitch)
- Weekly research cadence (Monday/Friday routines)

**Use this**: When you're confused about which research file to update or how to synthesize insights.

---

## 📈 Go-to-Market & Growth

### **8. GTM Strategy** (Launch Plan - Beta to 10K Users)
**File**: `gtm/GTM_STRATEGY.md`

**What it covers**:
- **4-phase launch plan**:
  - Phase 1 (Jan-Feb): Private Beta - 10 users (ISB warm contacts)
  - Phase 2 (Mar-Apr): Expanded Beta - 100 users (ISB mass email, LinkedIn, Reddit)
  - Phase 3 (May-Jun): Public Launch - 1,000 users (Product Hunt, Hacker News, YouTube influencers)
  - Phase 4 (Jul-Dec): Scale - 10,000 users (Paid ads, SEO, partnerships)

- **Unit economics**:
  - Free tier: $0 cost
  - Indie tier ($5/mo): $0.50 cost → 90% margin
  - Pro tier ($15/mo): $5 cost → 67% margin
  - Break-even: 100 paid users ($500-1,500 MRR)

- **Early adopter incentives**:
  - Free forever for first 100 users
  - Input on roadmap (co-creation)
  - Exclusive community (WhatsApp/Discord)
  - "Founding Member" badge

- **What NOT to do** (8 anti-patterns):
  - Don't spam ISB alumni list (personal outreach first)
  - Don't launch Product Hunt too early (<50% retention)
  - Don't promise features not in V1

**Action**: Read Phase 1 (Jan-Feb) now, skip Phases 2-4 until you hit 60% retention with 10 users.

---

### **9. Beta Outreach Log** (Track Your 20 Contacts)
**File**: `gtm/beta_outreach_log.md`

**What it covers**:
- 20-contact tracking table (name, channel, response, signup status)
- Response log with detailed notes template
- Non-responders follow-up queue (Day 3, 7, 10)
- Objection handling examples
- Referral tracking

**Action**: Fill this out as you send beta pitches (update daily).

---

### **10. Influencer Targets** (YouTube/Twitter for Phase 3)
**File**: `gtm/influencer_targets.md`

**What it covers**:
- 3 tiers of influencers:
  - **Top tier** (500K+ subs): Ali Abdaal, Thomas Frank (post-traction only)
  - **Micro** (50K-200K subs): August Bradley, Jeff Su ($500/video sponsorship)
  - **Nano** (<50K subs): Productivity Discord mods (free access for review)
- Budget: $2,500 for 5 sponsored videos (Phase 3)
- Outreach template with personalization
- Affiliate program alternative (20% commission)

**Action**: Don't touch this until Phase 3 (May-Jun). Focus on beta first.

---

### **11. Content Calendar** (Post-Launch Content Plan)
**File**: `gtm/content_calendar.md`

**What it covers**:
- Month 1 post-launch calendar (Week 1-4 detailed schedule)
- 4 content pillars: Building in public, User stories, Educational, Thought leadership
- Platform-specific guidelines (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Blog)
- SEO keyword targets (high-intent, educational, comparison)
- Content repurposing strategy (1 blog post → 10 content pieces)

**Action**: Don't start content until you hit 60% retention (otherwise you're marketing a broken product).

---

## 📊 Decision Framework

### **Week 1 (Dec 22 Decision)**:
- ✅ 10+ beta signups → Proceed to MVP build
- ❌ <5 signups → More outreach (send to 50 ISB alumni, not just 20)

### **Week 3 (Jan 5 Decision)**:
- ✅ Agent working, <3 critical bugs, 5+ dogfood days → Launch to beta users
- ❌ Agent broken OR >5 critical bugs → Extend 1 week, focus on stability

### **Week 4 (Jan 12 Decision - THE BIG ONE)**:
- ✅ Retention ≥50% (5/10 users) → Scale to 50 users (send ISB mass email)
- ⚠️ Retention 30-50% → Iterate, narrow ICP, rebuild for power users
- ❌ Retention <30% → Pivot meeting (What's broken? Persevere/Pivot/Kill?)

---

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

**Behind schedule?**
→ Cut scope (task breakdown is optional, agent core is not) OR extend timeline (6 weeks instead of 4)

**Co-founder drops out?**
→ Srikar continues solo (extend timeline to 6 weeks, focus on core features only)

**Zero beta signups?**
→ Mass email 50 ISB alumni (use Email Version A from `beta_pitch_v1.md`)

**0% retention at Week 4?**
→ Emergency pivot meeting within 24 hours (interview churned users, identify core problem)

**TickTick API breaks?**
→ Fallback to standalone PostgreSQL storage (drop TickTick dependency)

**OpenRouter rate limit?**
→ Switch to local Ollama (slower but free)

---

## 🎉 What Success Looks Like

### **1 Month (Jan 12)**:
- Srikar uses Context daily (prefers it over TickTick)
- 10 beta users, 60% retained at week 2 (6/10 users)
- 5 users say "I can't go back to my old system"

### **3 Months (Apr 12)**:
- 100 beta users (ISB alumni network)
- 50% retained at month 2
- NPS > 50 (strong word-of-mouth)
- First paying customer (even if just $5/mo)

### **6 Months (Jul 12)** - The Vision:
> "People speak about how they're getting more done, and worry less. They feel the app knows them, and even does some tasks for them. When they wake up, they know what to focus on for the day!"

### **1 Year (Dec 2026)**:
- 1,000 DAU (daily active users)
- $10K MRR (monthly recurring revenue)
- Srikar quits day job to work on Context full-time
- Expanding beyond ISB network (Product Hunt, YouTube influencers)

---

## 🛑 Quit Criteria (Honesty Check)

Srikar will quit if:
- He doesn't find Context useful for himself in 1 month
- He stops using it and goes back to just TickTick
- He loses interest in the problem

**BUT**: Even if only Srikar uses it, it's still success (solved his own problem).
