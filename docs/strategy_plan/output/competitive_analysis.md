## Our Advantages
The more you use Context, the better it understands your cognitive patterns (Myers-Briggs type, work style preferences, decision-making heuristics). Motion optimizes for calendar constraints; Context optimizes for YOUR brain. This creates switching costs—you'd lose your 'AI work twin' if you left

## Competitor Strengths
Motion (auto-scheduling), Reclaim.ai (calendar blocking), Sunsama (daily planning) - but not sure what they're good at vs what they don't do well.
