# Vision & Mission - Context

## The Problem
Productivity tools force everyone into the same workflow, but high-performers have fundamentally different cognitive styles. A Myers-Briggs "TJ" type needs crisp, structured tasks while an "FP" type gets overwhelmed by that rigidity—yet both need to execute 50+ tasks/week without burning out.

## Our Solution
AI that adapts to HOW you think, not just what you need to do. Context learns your personality-driven work style (structured vs. flexible, detail vs. big-picture) and translates tasks into YOUR language while protecting time for deep work and personal life.

## 3-Year Vision
The assistant that knows you well enough to say "I notice you're avoiding this ambiguous task—should we break it into 3 concrete steps like you prefer?" or "This feels like too much structure—let's keep it high-level and trust your intuition."
