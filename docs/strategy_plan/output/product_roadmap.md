# Product Roadmap - Context

## Current Stage
alpha

## Current Traction
Only me

## MVP Launch Target
Q1 2026

## Post-MVP Priorities
1. Mobile app (iOS/Android)
2. Personality type detection and adaptation (Myers-Briggs from task patterns)
3. Build context on users - what they do, people they work with, work style, and priorities.

## Key Milestones
M1: Private beta (10 users), M2: Public beta (100 users), M3: Paid tier launch, M4: 1,000 DAU

## Technical Debt / Risks
Only one guy vibe coding the app, still has a lot of learning on deploying at scale and for multiple users

## Current Blockers
Most features are still being built - trying to figure out GTM strategy so that I know what MVP to build
