# Market Analysis - Context

## Ideal Customer Profile
Product managers, startup founders, and consultants (50+ tasks/week) who've tried Motion/Reclaim/Sunsama but found them too rigid or impersonal. They need AI that adapts to their cognitive style, not another one-size-fits-all system.

## Market Size
AM: $2.3B productivity software market (Statista 2024). SAM: 2M knowledge workers using premium task managers (Motion: 10K users, Reclaim: 50K). SOM: 1K users by year-end (0.05% of SAM) = $60K ARR at $5-15/mo [Needs to be verified]

## Key Competitors
Motion (auto-scheduling), Reclaim.ai (calendar blocking), Sunsama (daily planning) - but not sure what they're good at vs what they don't do well.
| Feature                | Motion | Reclaim | Sunsama | Context* |
|------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Auto-scheduling  | ★★★★★  | ★★★☆☆   | ★★☆☆☆   | ★★★★☆  |
| Calendar sync      | ★★★☆☆  | ★★★★★   | ★★★★★   | ★★★☆☆   |
| Eisenhower view  | ★★☆☆☆  | ★☆☆☆☆   | ★★★☆☆   | ★★★★★   |
| Personality adapt | ★☆☆☆☆  | ★☆☆☆☆   | ★★☆☆☆   | ★★★★★   |
| Conversation        | ★★☆☆☆  | ★☆☆☆☆   | ★★★☆☆   | ★★★★★   |


## Competitive Advantages
The more you use Context, the better it understands your cognitive patterns (Myers-Briggs type, work style preferences, decision-making heuristics). Motion optimizes for calendar constraints; Context optimizes for YOUR brain. This creates switching costs—you'd lose your 'AI work twin' if you left
