# Technical Overview - Context

## Tech Stack
Next.js 14 frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL + ChromaDB for task history + embeddings, LangGraph for AI orchestration (supports Ollama for privacy, OpenRouter for speed, and SOTA models for quality) 

## Scalability Strategy
[Needs to be planned]

## AI/LLM Approach
Local models are slow and all machines cannot run great but fast small models. Proposing OpenRouter for cheaper models and higher tiers for SOTA models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) 

## Data Privacy & Security
User's tasks never leave their control. Compliance to be worked on.
