**Evening (3 hours)**
- [ ] **Design agent architecture**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/agent/README.md`
  - Document:
    - Flow: User message → LangGraph → Tool calls → Response
    - Tools: `create_task`, `list_tasks`, `complete_task`, `delete_task`, `suggest_breakdown`
    - SSE streaming setup (thinking vs message separation)
  - Review existing `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/agent/graph.py`

- [ ] **Test existing agent setup**

    - Parse due dates from natural language ("by Friday", "next Monday")
    - Extract priority from context ("urgent meeting" → High priority)
    - Auto-assign to correct project based on keywords
  - Test: `./scripts/test_agent.sh --query "Create task: Finish report by Friday, it's urgent"`

- [ ] **Test create_task end-to-end**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Scenarios:
    1. Simple: "Create task: Buy milk"
    2. Complex: "Schedule meeting with John next Tuesday at 2pm, high priority"
    3. Vague: "I need to work on the Q1 strategy"
  - Document: Does it correctly parse all fields? Any edge cases?

---

### Wednesday, Dec 25 (Christmas - REST DAY)
- [ ] **No work - rest and recharge** 🎄

---

### Thursday, Dec 26

**Evening (4 hours)**
- [ ] **Implement list_tasks tool enhancements**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/agent/tools.py`
  - Features:
    - Filter by quadrant: "What's urgent?" → Q1 tasks
    - Filter by project: "What's on my plate for Context?" → Project-specific tasks
    - Smart defaults: "What should I do today?" → Q1 + Q2 tasks due soon
  - Test: `./scripts/test_agent.sh --query "What's urgent and important?"`

- [ ] **Implement complete_task tool**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Features:
    - Fuzzy matching: "Mark report as done" → Finds "Finish Q4 report" task
    - Confirmation: "Marked 'Finish Q4 report' as complete. Great work!"
  - Test: Create task → Complete it via agent → Verify in TickTick

- [ ] **Frontend: Polish ChatPanel UI**
  - Owner: Co-founder (if frontend-focused) or Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/frontend/components/ChatPanel.tsx`
  - UX improvements:
    - Add typing indicator while agent is thinking
    - Show tool calls visually ("Creating task: Buy milk...")
    - Better error messages (no technical jargon)
  - Test in browser: Does it feel conversational?

---

### Friday, Dec 27

**Evening (3 hours)**
- [ ] **Add error handling and graceful degradation**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/agent/graph.py`
  - Scenarios to handle:
    - User asks something unrelated ("What's the weather?") → "I'm your task manager, ask me about tasks!"
    - TickTick API down → "I can't reach TickTick right now. Try again in a minute?"
    - Ambiguous request ("Delete my task") → "Which task? You have 5 active tasks."
  - Test error paths with `./scripts/test_agent.sh`

- [ ] **Dogfood session #1**
  - Owner: Srikar + Co-founder
  - Duration: 1 hour
  - Action: Use Context agent for ALL task management (no direct TickTick)
  - Track issues in `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/docs/strategy_plan/research/dogfood_log.md`
  - Format: "Issue: [description], Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low, Repro steps"

---

### Saturday, Dec 28 (Weekend - 5 hours)

**Morning (3 hours)**
- [ ] **Fix critical bugs from dogfooding**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Priority: Any bug that makes the agent unusable
  - Examples:
    - Agent doesn't respond (timeout issues)
    - Tasks created with wrong due date
    - List tasks returns empty even though tasks exist
  - Test fixes: Re-run failed scenarios from dogfood session

**Afternoon (2 hours)**
- [ ] **Implement task avoidance detection (MVP version)**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/services/avoidance_detector.py`
  - Logic:
    - If task created >2 weeks ago AND no status change → Flag as "avoided"
    - If task has been rescheduled 3+ times → Flag as "chronic procrastination"
  - Agent behavior: When listing tasks, add note: "You've been avoiding this for 2 weeks. Too vague?"

- [ ] **Test avoidance detection**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Create backdated tasks in test DB (simulate 2-week-old tasks)
  - Ask agent: "What am I avoiding?"
  - Expected: Agent surfaces old tasks and asks clarifying questions

---

### Sunday, Dec 29 (Weekend - 4 hours)

**Morning (2.5 hours)**
- [ ] **Implement task breakdown suggestion**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/agent/tools.py`
  - New tool: `suggest_breakdown(task_id)`
  - Logic:
    - Send task title/description to LLM
    - Prompt: "Break this into 3-5 concrete, actionable subtasks"
    - Return subtasks as checklist
  - Integration: Agent offers breakdown when user says "This feels overwhelming" or when task is flagged as avoided

- [ ] **Test breakdown quality**
  - Owner: Srikar + Co-founder
  - Test cases:
    1. Vague task: "Plan Q1 strategy" → Should get specific steps
    2. Concrete task: "Send email to John" → Should NOT need breakdown
    3. Complex task: "Migrate backend to new database" → Should get technical subtasks
  - Quality check: Are subtasks actually actionable?

**Afternoon (1.5 hours)**
- [ ] **Add personality preference tracking (hardcoded MVP)**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/models/user.py`
  - Add field: `work_style_preference` (enum: 'structured', 'flexible', 'unknown')
  - For MVP: Hardcode Srikar's preference to 'structured'
  - Agent behavior:
    - If 'structured': Always offer breakdown for vague tasks
    - If 'flexible': Offer breakdown only when explicitly asked
  - Test: Ask agent to break down task → Should match Srikar's preference

- [ ] **Week 2 retrospective**
  - Owner: Both
  - 30-min Zoom call
  - Review: Is the agent core working? Can Srikar dogfood it daily?
  - Blockers: What's preventing daily use?

**Week 2 Deliverables (CHECK BEFORE MOVING TO WEEK 3)**:
- ✅ Agent can create, list, complete tasks via conversation
- ✅ Avoidance detection flags old tasks
- ✅ Task breakdown generates useful subtasks
- ✅ Srikar used Context for 2+ days (dogfood log has entries)
- ✅ <5 critical bugs remaining

---

## Week 3: Polish & Dogfood Iteration (Dec 30 - Jan 5)

**Focus**: Make the product good enough to share. Fix UX friction, optimize performance, prepare for beta users.

### Monday, Dec 30

    - Reduce LLM token count (trim system prompts)
    - Use faster OpenRouter model for simple queries (DeepSeek vs Claude)
  - Test: `time ./scripts/test_agent.sh --query "What's urgent?"`
  - Target: <2 sec from request to first SSE chunk

- [ ] **Database query optimization**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/api/tasks.py`
  - Add indexes:
    - `idx_user_created_at` on `(user_id, created_at DESC)` for avoidance detection
    - `idx_user_status_quadrant` on `(user_id, status, eisenhower_quadrant)` for list_tasks
  - Migration: `cd /Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add indexes for agent performance"`

  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/backend/app/core/analytics.py`
  - Test: Create task via agent → Check PostHog dashboard for event

- [ ] **Create beta onboarding flow**
  - Owner: Co-founder (or Srikar)
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/frontend/components/OnboardingModal.tsx`
  - Steps:
    1. "Welcome to Context! Let me show you around (1 min)"
    2. "Try this: Ask me 'Create task: Test Context'"
    3. "Pro tip: I can detect tasks you're avoiding. Just ask 'What am I procrastinating on?'"
  - Auto-show for new users, dismissable

## Post-Launch: Week 5-6 Decision Tree (Jan 13-26)

### Path A: Retention is GOOD (≥50%)

**Week 5 Focus: Scale to 50 users**
- [ ] **Prepare mass email campaign for ISB alumni**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Audience: 50 ISB alumni (expand beyond initial 20)
  - Message: Social proof ("10 ISB folks tested this, 60% use it daily"), scarcity ("Limited spots for next cohort")
  - Include: Testimonials from beta users

- [ ] **Add top 2 requested features**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Examples: Calendar blocking, email drafting, recurring tasks
  - Ship incrementally (1 feature per week)

- [ ] **Implement soft paywall**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Free tier: 10 tasks/month + basic agent
  - Indie tier ($5/mo): Unlimited tasks + avoidance detection + personality adaptation
  - Goal: Test willingness to pay (5% conversion = 3/50 users)

**Week 6 Focus: Product Hunt prep**
- [ ] **Create Product Hunt assets**
  - Owner: Co-founder
  - Thumbnail, screenshots, demo video (60 sec)
  - Tagline: "AI task manager that adapts to how YOU think"

- [ ] **Build email waitlist**
  - Owner: Co-founder
  - Landing page with signup form
  - Target: 100 email signups before PH launch

---

### Path B: Retention is BAD (<30%)

**Week 5 Focus: Root cause analysis**
- [ ] **Interview all churned users**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Questions: Why did you stop? What would have kept you using it?
  - Goal: Identify pattern (Is it UX? Value prop? Bugs? TickTick dependency?)

- [ ] **Competitive re-analysis**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - Revisit Motion, Reclaim, Sunsama: What are we missing?
  - Hypothesis: Maybe users want auto-scheduling > personality adaptation?

- [ ] **Prototype alternative "Aha Moment"**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - If avoidance detection didn't resonate, test:
    - Auto-scheduling (like Motion)
    - Email drafting (unique to Context)
    - Daily summary email (like Sunsama)
  - Ship to 5 beta users, measure engagement

**Week 6 Focus: Pivot or persevere decision**
- [ ] **Founder alignment session**
  - Owner: Both
  - Hard questions:
    - Is the market real? (Did we solve a problem people care about?)
    - Is the solution right? (Did we build the wrong features?)
    - Is the target user right? (Should we focus on founders vs PMs vs students?)
    - Do we have runway? (Can we afford another 4 weeks?)
  - Outcomes:
    - Persevere: Rebuild V2 with new "Aha Moment", 4-week timeline
    - Pivot: Change target user or core feature, restart customer discovery
    - Kill: Shut down, share learnings publicly, move to next idea

- [ ] **Document decision**
  - Owner: Srikar
  - File: `/Users/srikar.kandikonda/Desktop/Claude/Task-management/docs/strategy_plan/PIVOT_DECISION.md`
  - Sections: What we learned, why we're pivoting/persevering, next 30 days

## Final Notes

### Philosophy
- **Ship fast, learn faster**: Beta doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be good enough to learn from.
- **Ruthless prioritization**: Only build features that directly support the "Aha Moment" (avoidance detection + task breakdown).
- **Honest communication**: Tell beta users "This is rough. Help me make it great."
- **Measure what matters**: Retention > Features. If users don't come back, nothing else matters.

### Mindset for Nights & Weekends
- **Protect your energy**: 15-20 hours/week is sustainable. 40 hours/week leads to burnout.
- **Focus on code, not meetings**: Limit calls to customer interviews. No status meetings.
- **Batch similar tasks**: Code on weeknights, customer calls on weekends.
- **Celebrate small wins**: Shipped a feature? Fixed a bug? High-five yourself.

### When to Adjust the Plan
- **Add 1 week buffer** if critical bugs emerge during Week 3
- **Extend to 6 weeks** if co-founder drops out
- **Pivot immediately** if Week 1 interviews reveal a broken hypothesis
- **Kill fast** if Week 4 retention is 0% (don't throw good time after bad)

---

**Remember**: This is YOUR roadmap. Check off tasks as you complete them. Adjust deadlines if needed. The goal is shipping a beta that teaches you something, not perfection.

**Let's build something people love. 🚀**
